    <h1>Omelet</h1>
    <p><img src="../img/omelet.jpg"></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs, obviously</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Soy sauce/Fish sauce</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Break the eggs, preferably more than one. Beat it softly.</li>
        <li>Set your pan, preferably a wok. Oil generously the pan/wok, let the heat be medium or medium to high</li>
        <img src="../img/wok.gif">
        <li>You can choose either salt or fish sauce. Fish sauce or soy sauce will give an extra umami taste to the omelet, while providing the salt. Salt on the other hand, will give a light clear taste to the omelet, while umami solely come from the egg.
            Eitherway, umami will blow your mind.(I don't need the last sentence, but I just want to put it there, so I can show you this gif.</li>
        <img src="../img/mindblown.gif">
        <li>Make sure to salt the egg just right before pouring the egg onto the pan/wok. This is because, it will create a more congealed egg mixture ensuring a fluffy and moisture-less base of the omelet. Failure in doing so, will create a mushy base which
            will suck all the moisture into the omelet, taking fluffy base out of the equation.</li>
        <li>Once the wok/pan heated (little wasp of smoke), pour in the egg mixture and let it settle.</li>
        <li>Now, the egg mixture will cooked from outside leaving the inside still goupy mixture. Raise the cooked part and let the goupy part slides underneath the base of the omelet, and rest the cooked base on goupy mixture.</li>
        <li>You can repeat this step until all the mixture is cooked. Now, turn down the heat to medium low.</li>
        <li>Flip the omelet and let still for 15-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat. Serve it on a plate with a serving of hot rice.</li>
    </ol>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Pretty complicated step-to-step to only cook an omelet but its worth it. Oil need to be heated, until you can see the wasp of smokes. Oil that not heated to that degree, would make the omelet greasy and full of oil.</li>
        <li>Control the heat, and timing of salting the egg is important.</li>
    </ul>

    Good Luck!
